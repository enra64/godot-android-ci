# godot-android-ci
A docker image for exporting godot games to android, too.

Most of the godot configuration can be read up on here: https://github.com/aBARICHELLO/godot-ci, because that's where that is from.

The godot-to-android export is from here: https://github.com/myood/godot-ci-android-export, so you can look there for config info.

The android SDK stuff is configured mostly via the packages.txt.
